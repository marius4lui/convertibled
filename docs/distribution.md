# Distribution implementation

The Python standard-library installer/updater owns immutable version directories,
root-only transactions, and OpenSSL Ed25519 verification. Fedora 44 supplies
Python 3 and OpenSSL; these are platform prerequisites, not bundled interpreters.
Release metadata uses schema 1, monotonically increasing per-channel sequences,
UTC issuance/expiry (at most 31 days), an exact platform contract, SHA256/size,
configuration schema and bounded release notes. Stable rejects preview versions.
No production trust key is committed. Without provisioned trust, updates fail
closed. Physical installation and GNOME activation remain acceptance gates.

Signed envelopes contain `key_id`, `payload`, `signature` (base64). Signatures
cover canonical UTF-8 JSON (sorted keys, compact separators). The offline root
signs a release-keyring with an independent monotonic sequence and UTC lifetime.
Only keys in that authenticated keyring may sign channel metadata; removing a
key revokes it. Root replacement requires an explicit administrator trust action.

State writes fsync content and parent directory before proceeding. A nonblocking
flock serializes mutations on Linux. The active symlink may point only to a direct
child of the versions directory; directory/state symlinks are rejected.
