# GNOME tablet workspace

The extension targets GNOME Shell 50 and is compiled from TypeScript to GJS
ES modules. `cd extension && npm ci && npm test` builds a distributable `dist`
directory. The project installer owns deployment; development never installs
the extension on this Windows host.

GI/Shell bindings are runtime boundaries; portable policy is checked strictly.
GNOME runtime and physical touch acceptance are not established by Node tests.
